If you want to run it on your device, you'll need to set up with MongoDB and shit
" Use npm install in server and client folders
  Create MongoDB cluster in MongoDB atlas
  Create .env file in server folder and add -> MONGO_URI="Your_Own_MongoDB_Database_Link"
  (I already included the .env file, use your own unique links)
  To start server: cd server -> npm start [This runs on localhost:5000]
  To start client: cd client -> npm start [This runs on localhost:3000]

  Current important urls:
  localhost:5000/login - This is needed inorder to authenticate before anything else.
  localhost:3000/home - Currently these buttons only work as remote control (needs to change to player buttons instead) "

Only works with premium spotify (idk why)
